# Riverr - Senior Frontend Technical Test

### Note: this is deliberately terrible code, and part of an interview exercise to aide in discussions on pairing, technical debt and code quality. This isn't representative of how we do things at Riverr!

## The scenario

A junior developer has created a feature to add stock items to a table within an inventory management application.

They were asked to create a 'add stock to table' feature that:

- Lets you add new stock items
- Lets you mark stock as low quantity
- Remove stock items.
- Has some basic styling

## The exercise

Make amendments to get the code into a state that you believe represents best-practice for frontend development & meet's the requirements defined above.

You're free to introduce any new dependencies you like.

**Note**: We have intentionally introduced a number of mistakes in the code, typos, bugs, bad practice and everything in between.

### Things to consider

- What opportunities for refactoring exist?
- How is TypeScript being used in the component?
- What React related bugs might exist in the implementation?
- What's the test coverage like? What tests should be in place?
- How is styling implemented?
- How is the project structured?

### Time limit

To help set expectations for the coding exercise, We do not expect the entire test to be completed in the time allocated. We simply want to see how you break down the task and assess the structure/quality of the code you produce.

### Assumptions

For the purposes of the exercise, you can assume:

- That the visual appearance of the component is acceptable
- That the component is functionally complete, but buggy - we'll pretend that the purely in-memory state for the order list is acceptable for now.

### Commands

`npm install` and `npm start` should get you up and running on `localhost:3000`

### Submission / Editing

Once complete, please export your review as a PDF and send a link to your code sandbox solution. If you chose to clone and work locally, please commit the code to a public GitHub repository for us to view. Also, ensure to include accurate instructions within the README of the repo to enable us to run the code locally.

Once this is sorted, simply email over the link and document. Also feel free to let us know anything you would have changed/implemented if given more time.
